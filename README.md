Window 10 Desktop Clock Gadget (VB.Net)

Back in the day, Windows used to have special applets known as "gadgets" that sort of hung around on the desktop. One such gadget that my dear mother loved and used was the analog clock.

Lo and behold, it turns out gadgets exposed security issues and were deprecated. Poor mom was heart-broken. Not to mention perturbed with Microsoft for removing the clock during an update (without her consent or permission).

In any event, one day as I was listening to this story for the umpteenth time, I decided to rectify matters.

<q>Mom, I'll write you a durned clock gadget!</q>, I cried.

And so this project was born. It's not polished up and there are some things I started out to put in there and never got around to it. But it works well enough for her.

Now I listen to stories about how I saved the day when Microsoft stole her clock. :P

Here's a link to another brief description:
